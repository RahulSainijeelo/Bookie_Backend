Dear HR Manager,

Thank you for the reminder regarding the Developer Practical Task submission. I have completed the task and just submitted it through the provided Google Form link.

I have implemented a full-stack solution that includes both frontend and backend components. The submission is include:
- Complete GitHub repository with clean, documented code
- Clear indication of the full-stack implementation
- Screenshots demonstrating the application functionality
- Brief video walkthrough of key features

I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my Full Stack development skills and look forward to discussing the next steps of the process.

Best regards,
Rahul Saini
